# indian_ecosystem_LP1
First project work for the Azubi Data analysis course, this repo represents the first Sprint of the career accelerator phase. It investigates and analyses our team's desire to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem. It shows an analysis of funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021 and Separate data for each year of funding will be provided.


# Overview
In the pursuit of exploring opportunities within the Indian start-up ecosystem, our team has tasked the data expert (you!) with the responsibility of investigating and proposing the best course of action. The primary focus is on analyzing the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. The datasets provided contain crucial information such as start-ups' details, funding amounts received, and investors' information.

# Objectives
1. Analyze Funding Trends: Dive deep into the funding landscape for Indian start-ups from 2018 to 2021. Identify trends, patterns, and insights to guide decision-making.

2. Year-wise Breakdown: Separate and analyze the data for each year to understand how funding trends have evolved over time.

3. Comprehensive Dataset: Integrate data from diverse sources to create a comprehensive dataset. In a real-world production environment, data often comes from multiple places, and as a data analyst, your task is to consolidate and make sense of this varied information.

# Data Sources
The dataset for this project is not confined to a single source. Instead, it is distributed across three different places. As a data analyst, you will need to gather data from these varied sources and merge them to form a unified dataset. This mirrors the challenges encountered in a real-world production environment where data is obtained from diverse sources.

# Project Structure
The repository is organized to facilitate seamless collaboration and understanding of the project. The main components include:

1. Data: Contains the datasets from the three different sources. Subfolders may be created to organize data by year.

2. Analysis: This section houses the Jupyter notebooks, scripts, or any code used for data analysis. It should provide step-by-step insights into how the investigation was conducted.

3. Results: Summarize the key findings, trends, and proposed actions based on the analysis. Visualizations and reports can be included here.

4. Documentation: Additional documentation, if needed, to explain the methodology, data cleaning steps, and any assumptions made during the analysis.
